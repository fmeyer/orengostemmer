# DEPRECATED orengostemmer
Orengo's portuguese steammer implementation as Solr filter



As today Lucene's implement this on https://lucene.apache.org/core/6_1_0/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/pt/PortugueseStemmer.html I'm merally keeping this for historical reasons. During the time (2012) it was necessary and served well an average of 8000 queries per second.
